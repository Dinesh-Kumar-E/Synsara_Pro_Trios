Tim Burton['Michael Keaton', 'Danny DeVito', 'Michelle Pfeiffer']Very rarely do movie sequels ever match the grandeur of the originals. BATMAN RETURNS however, does so with gusto. The sequel to 1989&apos;s BATMAN, BATMAN RETURNS neither milks the success of the first movie nor totally disregards it; it&apos;s a wonderful sequel and a spectacular movie in its own right. There&apos;s something for everyone in this movie - humor, high drama, plenty of action, and lots of cool things to look at. Of course, viewers have to get around Tim Burton&apos;s morbid and sometimes offensive sense of humor, but that shouldn&apos;t be too much of a problem in this era of SOUTH PARK and THERE&apos;S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. While the movie has many great moments, it also has its flaws. The plot seems rushed, stitched together. Danny DeVito tries his best as the Penguin but doesn&apos;t quite pull it off. Christopher Walken appears as a secondary bad guy, but his performance is lackluster compared to the others. And many of the action sequences, though breathtaking, seemed forced and are occasionally absurd. All that aside, there&apos;s all kinds of surprises in this movie - smart humor and dialogue, characters you can&apos;t help but love, lots of satire (Homer&apos;s Iliad, CITIZEN KANE, and the American political scene are all lampooned), and many memorable scenes that only serve as a testament to Burton&apos;s colorful imagination. I hope to get this movie on DVD, where I can enjoy it on my big screen TV in all its glory. Not exactly the best Batman film ever, but still a fascinating movie to watch over and over again.7.1

Pierre Morel['Liam Neeson', 'Maggie Grace', 'Famke Janssen']I saw this movie tonight at the sneak preview and I was completely surprised and blown away. I went to see this movie with no expectations. In the beginning it seems that it was going to be an easy to watch movie, but after a short time it turned into a high-speed action movie. I found the story original and so did my friends. At some times I found it hard to watch, because of the drug abuse and violence. To know that these practices still occur also gave me a horrible feeling. I was completely taken away by this movie. At some points it was very very quiet in the cinema, because of the excitement, you wonder what is going to happen next. Some moments in the story I found a bit not convincing, but the rest of the movie makes up to that. Liam Neeson in one of his best performances. It had good action, a good story, some humor. There are also some sensitive / sentimental scenes. There are no plot twists. It is just a story being told. This is one of those movies which stay in your memory for a while and let you think about bad things that happen. The movie that had that same effect on me was Traffic (2000). Personally I think this movie is underrated, but maybe this is because it is new. I would give it 8/10.7.8

James Cameron['Arnold Schwarzenegger', 'Linda Hamilton', 'Michael Biehn']Many people look back at the films of James Cameron and suggest that the smaller, the budget, the tighter the limitations, the better the end product. Films like Avatar, Titanic and True Lies had huge budgets and drew in even bigger box office but many still yearn for the Cameron that gave us The Terminator and Aliens which were huge movies but packed a far bigger punch artistically. My feelings all these years on are that Cameron has earned the right to make those huge movies but i have to admit to preferring his earlier body of work. The Terminator is a nightmarish, time travelling science fiction film told at a breakneck pace and delivered with confidence and style. The film has a very gritty, underground look to it and does a great job of telling its story amid the frenetic action. There is also a huge slice of horror and suspense thrown in, an impression that has diminished in the years since it&apos;s release due to inferior sequels. Viewed as a standalone piece however, The Terminator is fine piece of work from a director with a very clear vision.Everyone knows that The Terminator is the film that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger but when i look back at the film, it has heart and its the Michael Biehn character, Kyle Reese, that provides it Artistically speaking,Cameron might be well advised that less is more.8.1

John McTiernan['Bruce Willis', 'Alan Rickman', 'Bonnie Bedelia']I&apos;ve got to admit, I only really watched this movie because of the (many, many) references in Brooklyn 99. And I got thinking, is Die Hard really that good? So, I gave it a watch, guided by the many, many Jake Peralta jokes that I had grown accustomed to. And I&apos;ve got to say, this is the action movie that paved the way for all future action movies.

I usually have an aversion to Christmas movies as they all tend to turn into cheesy rom-coms but this was pretty awesome. And I think the reason for that is because that even though it was Christmassy where it mattered, the plot didn&apos;t completely revolve around it.

I&apos;ve got to admit, most of it was guns and explosions and there was very little plot to go off of besides a pretty traditional three-act structure, but it was still pretty damn entertaining. And you know it&apos;s a good movie when about 90% of it was guns and blood and explosions and the other 10% was Bruce Willis saying badass things and crawling through vents in an ever-disintegrating tank top, and you stilled enjoyed it.

There was never a still moment in this movie, but unlike most times, where I just end up getting bored of the CGI-fest explosions, I was actually pretty captivated through the entire runtime. I&apos;m actually really pleasantly surprised. The ending is predictable, but it&apos;s nice. Not all movies have to be intellectual masterpieces. Sometimes you just need to switch your brain of a little and watch Bruce Willis kick ass.

So, Jake of B99 was right. I mean, it&apos;s badass, Bruce Willis has the best one-liners, you have cool explosions. There&apos;s not too much more I could say about this movie. Yippie kayak, other buckets.

David Yates['Daniel Radcliffe', 'Emma Watson', 'Rupert Grint']Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) 

** 1/2 (out of 4)

Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is brought back to school where he faces a possible expulsion after using magic in the real world. Dumbledore (Jim McManus) comes to his defense and soon the two of them are warning people of the return of Lord Voldemort.

As I&apos;ve said in the reviews for the previous films, I haven&apos;t read any of the stories so I honestly can&apos;t compare the movie to the book. With that said, I did find the previous installment to be an extremely entertaining movie and certainly the best of the series to date. This fifth film is certainly a major step backwards and sadly there are way too many boring moments to make it a complete winner.

Again, perhaps I would have picked up on more things had I been familiar with the book but I personally found the majority of the first half to be quite boring without too many interesting things going on. I honestly thought there was very little character development and I thought too many of the scenes just kept dragging on with dialogue that just wasn&apos;t all that interesting or thrilling.

The film does finally pick up during its final act and this is where thing get really good. The final battles almost rival what we saw in the previous film and there&apos;s no question that they pack a lot of energy and excitement. They also benefit from some wonderful special effects that really put you in the middle of the action and blend perfectly well with the cast members. Speaking of the cast, a lot of talented actors keep getting added to the series and once again everyone is quite impressive. Regulars like Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and others return to their roles quite nicely and people like Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis are of great value.7.5
Chris Columbus['Daniel Radcliffe', 'Rupert Grint', 'Emma Watson']None7.4
Chris Columbus['Daniel Radcliffe', 'Rupert Grint', 'Richard Harris']To be faced with the challenge of adapting Harry Potter for the Silver screen must have been any director&apos;s nightmare- the chance of directing possibly the biggest film of this decade, but also the hardest audience-the millions of fans of the book who know every line and will pick up on every mistake. Being one of the above, I can only say that Christopher Columbus and all of the team working on HP did marvelously. The cast was brilliant (particularly notable are Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and the eerily creepy David Bradley as Argus Filch), the directing wonderful, and the scenery perfect. The only qualm is that it does not track perfectly with the book, but squeezed into 2.5 hours, this can only be expected. Well done all involved!7.6
