Tim Burton['Michael Keaton', 'Danny DeVito', 'Michelle Pfeiffer']Very rarely do movie sequels ever match the grandeur of the originals. BATMAN RETURNS however, does so with gusto. The sequel to 1989&apos;s BATMAN, BATMAN RETURNS neither milks the success of the first movie nor totally disregards it; it&apos;s a wonderful sequel and a spectacular movie in its own right. There&apos;s something for everyone in this movie - humor, high drama, plenty of action, and lots of cool things to look at. Of course, viewers have to get around Tim Burton&apos;s morbid and sometimes offensive sense of humor, but that shouldn&apos;t be too much of a problem in this era of SOUTH PARK and THERE&apos;S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. While the movie has many great moments, it also has its flaws. The plot seems rushed, stitched together. Danny DeVito tries his best as the Penguin but doesn&apos;t quite pull it off. Christopher Walken appears as a secondary bad guy, but his performance is lackluster compared to the others. And many of the action sequences, though breathtaking, seemed forced and are occasionally absurd. All that aside, there&apos;s all kinds of surprises in this movie - smart humor and dialogue, characters you can&apos;t help but love, lots of satire (Homer&apos;s Iliad, CITIZEN KANE, and the American political scene are all lampooned), and many memorable scenes that only serve as a testament to Burton&apos;s colorful imagination. I hope to get this movie on DVD, where I can enjoy it on my big screen TV in all its glory. Not exactly the best Batman film ever, but still a fascinating movie to watch over and over again.7.1

Pierre Morel['Liam Neeson', 'Maggie Grace', 'Famke Janssen']I saw this movie tonight at the sneak preview and I was completely surprised and blown away. I went to see this movie with no expectations. In the beginning it seems that it was going to be an easy to watch movie, but after a short time it turned into a high-speed action movie. I found the story original and so did my friends. At some times I found it hard to watch, because of the drug abuse and violence. To know that these practices still occur also gave me a horrible feeling. I was completely taken away by this movie. At some points it was very very quiet in the cinema, because of the excitement, you wonder what is going to happen next. Some moments in the story I found a bit not convincing, but the rest of the movie makes up to that. Liam Neeson in one of his best performances. It had good action, a good story, some humor. There are also some sensitive / sentimental scenes. There are no plot twists. It is just a story being told. This is one of those movies which stay in your memory for a while and let you think about bad things that happen. The movie that had that same effect on me was Traffic (2000). Personally I think this movie is underrated, but maybe this is because it is new. I would give it 8/10.7.8

James Cameron['Arnold Schwarzenegger', 'Linda Hamilton', 'Michael Biehn']Many people look back at the films of James Cameron and suggest that the smaller, the budget, the tighter the limitations, the better the end product. Films like Avatar, Titanic and True Lies had huge budgets and drew in even bigger box office but many still yearn for the Cameron that gave us The Terminator and Aliens which were huge movies but packed a far bigger punch artistically. My feelings all these years on are that Cameron has earned the right to make those huge movies but i have to admit to preferring his earlier body of work. The Terminator is a nightmarish, time travelling science fiction film told at a breakneck pace and delivered with confidence and style. The film has a very gritty, underground look to it and does a great job of telling its story amid the frenetic action. There is also a huge slice of horror and suspense thrown in, an impression that has diminished in the years since it&apos;s release due to inferior sequels. Viewed as a standalone piece however, The Terminator is fine piece of work from a director with a very clear vision.Everyone knows that The Terminator is the film that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger but when i look back at the film, it has heart and its the Michael Biehn character, Kyle Reese, that provides it Artistically speaking,Cameron might be well advised that less is more.8.1

John McTiernan['Bruce Willis', 'Alan Rickman', 'Bonnie Bedelia']I&apos;ve got to admit, I only really watched this movie because of the (many, many) references in Brooklyn 99. And I got thinking, is Die Hard really that good? So, I gave it a watch, guided by the many, many Jake Peralta jokes that I had grown accustomed to. And I&apos;ve got to say, this is the action movie that paved the way for all future action movies.

I usually have an aversion to Christmas movies as they all tend to turn into cheesy rom-coms but this was pretty awesome. And I think the reason for that is because that even though it was Christmassy where it mattered, the plot didn&apos;t completely revolve around it.

I&apos;ve got to admit, most of it was guns and explosions and there was very little plot to go off of besides a pretty traditional three-act structure, but it was still pretty damn entertaining. And you know it&apos;s a good movie when about 90% of it was guns and blood and explosions and the other 10% was Bruce Willis saying badass things and crawling through vents in an ever-disintegrating tank top, and you stilled enjoyed it.

There was never a still moment in this movie, but unlike most times, where I just end up getting bored of the CGI-fest explosions, I was actually pretty captivated through the entire runtime. I&apos;m actually really pleasantly surprised. The ending is predictable, but it&apos;s nice. Not all movies have to be intellectual masterpieces. Sometimes you just need to switch your brain of a little and watch Bruce Willis kick ass.

So, Jake of B99 was right. I mean, it&apos;s badass, Bruce Willis has the best one-liners, you have cool explosions. There&apos;s not too much more I could say about this movie. Yippie kayak, other buckets.

David Yates['Daniel Radcliffe', 'Emma Watson', 'Rupert Grint']Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) 

** 1/2 (out of 4)

Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is brought back to school where he faces a possible expulsion after using magic in the real world. Dumbledore (Jim McManus) comes to his defense and soon the two of them are warning people of the return of Lord Voldemort.

As I&apos;ve said in the reviews for the previous films, I haven&apos;t read any of the stories so I honestly can&apos;t compare the movie to the book. With that said, I did find the previous installment to be an extremely entertaining movie and certainly the best of the series to date. This fifth film is certainly a major step backwards and sadly there are way too many boring moments to make it a complete winner.

Again, perhaps I would have picked up on more things had I been familiar with the book but I personally found the majority of the first half to be quite boring without too many interesting things going on. I honestly thought there was very little character development and I thought too many of the scenes just kept dragging on with dialogue that just wasn&apos;t all that interesting or thrilling.

The film does finally pick up during its final act and this is where thing get really good. The final battles almost rival what we saw in the previous film and there&apos;s no question that they pack a lot of energy and excitement. They also benefit from some wonderful special effects that really put you in the middle of the action and blend perfectly well with the cast members. Speaking of the cast, a lot of talented actors keep getting added to the series and once again everyone is quite impressive. Regulars like Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and others return to their roles quite nicely and people like Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis are of great value.7.5
Chris Columbus['Daniel Radcliffe', 'Rupert Grint', 'Emma Watson']None7.4
Chris Columbus['Daniel Radcliffe', 'Rupert Grint', 'Richard Harris']To be faced with the challenge of adapting Harry Potter for the Silver screen must have been any director&apos;s nightmare- the chance of directing possibly the biggest film of this decade, but also the hardest audience-the millions of fans of the book who know every line and will pick up on every mistake. Being one of the above, I can only say that Christopher Columbus and all of the team working on HP did marvelously. The cast was brilliant (particularly notable are Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and the eerily creepy David Bradley as Argus Filch), the directing wonderful, and the scenery perfect. The only qualm is that it does not track perfectly with the book, but squeezed into 2.5 hours, this can only be expected. Well done all involved!7.6

Pierre Morel['Liam Neeson', 'Maggie Grace', 'Famke Janssen']Stripped of all complexity this major Box Office Hit is nothing more than a great way to release some pent up frustration about some despicable things that continue to go on with impunity around the World. For those who maintain that it is Xenophobic and Racist, well it has to be set somewhere and the Villains have to be somebody. 

So pick one. It really doesn&apos;t matter. There is no argument that America is also filled with such Evil and nastiness that it might have taken place in the good olé US of A. These things matter little in these Comic-Book Movies. Nothing seems plausible or realistic, hence Comic-Book Category, but it is so much fun watching the really Bad Guys get a really good comeuppance.

There is some very mediocre Acting (just about everyone except Liam) and the Movie never lets up enough to make anyone think about what is happening, and it shouldn&apos;t. This is for the tired of it all People who are sick of the apathy and talk and just want some good old fashioned Payback. Justice...Revenge...Karma. 

So forget deep Sociological analysis, or anything that makes any intellectual sense. This is here to continue the thing that makes great Fiction. Viva the Fictional Vigilante.7.8

Justin TippingJahking Guillory, Christopher Meyer, Christopher Jordan WallaceA gorgeously done look at street life.

Kid saves some money to buy the fresh new Jordans to put on his feet other than the holely skips he was wearing, his life already changes from the confidence boost with a new swagger that attracts the girls. It also attracts trouble when the local crazy dude steels his kicks. Now the kid becomes obsessed with taking the slippers he&apos;s now force to wear off his feet and getting back his kicks at all cost.

I remember this life as a kid and how important Kicks were, and it sucks that Kids still have to worry about having their shoes taken. Then again, those 1st addiction Jordans could help pay someone&apos;s rent and put food on the table.

At first glace, its a horrible look at the what happens when you introduced Jordans to this culture (it seems to me not coincidence that the movie is about the re editions of the 1st Jordans), but all of that is superficial to the message of what really is important in life.

The young acting cast is very good, but I can&apos;t help but to give a shout out to Christopher Wallace Jr. not just because I&apos;m a fan of his father Biggie Smalls, but I think it&apos;s cool that he&apos;s an actor and he&apos;s good at it.

Overall, kicks gives me that colorful feeling I got when I saw Dope and Dear White People, although it has slightly more of a serious tone to it, and it needs that to get the message across. I like where all three of these films are going and how they are going there. Kicks is worth seeing.6.4

The acting, the world-building, the character depth, and the thrill of such an incredible depiction of the time period. I didn&apos;t think it was possible to make an accounting of the Trojan war void of the supernatural presence of the Greek Gods that rivals the old story in excellence, but this movie does.7.3

Molly BernsteinRicky Jay, Winston Simone, Dick CavettA glass one-third empty, two-third full kind of film. The two-thirds that are rich and brimming is the wonderful introduction the various colorful artists who mentored Ricky Jay into arguably the foremost card magician of our time. It&apos;s a lineage we learn that is handed down very personally, from generation to generation and then only in bits and pieces. Jay tells great stories of the men who inspired and tutored him. And we occasionally see terrific glimpses of them performing in some great found old footage.

The second full third are the wonderful, if all too brief times we to watch Jay&apos;s amazing artistry with cards and card tricks. Slight of hand at this level is truly beautiful -- a dance of illusion. There&apos;s a silky smoothness to Jay&apos;s movements that works in wonderful tandem with this spikey, off-beat, almost dangerous on stage persona. 

The third that&apos;s missing is a deeper exploration of the man himself. By his own admission Jay keeps the world at bay. We hear a very few tantalizing bits about his boyhood family life away from magic, but then that&apos;s put aside (even his manager of 20+ years admits he knows better than to ask Ricky about his childhood). Only near the very end of the film do we even learn that Jay is married, and that his wife seems to be a huge part of his life. Then this too is moved on from. I can accept that Jay and perhaps director Molly Bernstein wanted to keep the film focused largely on Jay&apos;s mentors, but, for my taste, they took the &apos;mysteries&apos; part of the title a bit too seriously. 

It&apos;s frustrating to watch a truly striking human being talk about their life and craft for 90 minutes, and realize you know little more about them at the end than at the beginning. Again, it seems intentional. Jay wants to keep his personal mysteries to himself. But it leaves a very entertaining and well made film feeling a touch incomplete. That said, this is still very worth seeing. I was never bored, sometimes astonished, and heard amazing stories I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll soon forget.7.1

Sara NewensAriel Hsing, Michael Landers, Lily ZhangThis well presented documentary, directed by Sara Newens and Mina T. Son, focuses mainly on 3 American teen table tennis phenoms, namely Ariel Hsing, Lily Zhang, and Michael Landers. The film follows them as they arduously and relentlessly train, with the hopes of making the U.S. Olympic Team, heading to London in 2012.

We&apos;ll follow the 3 teens as they continually practice through training or tournaments, to try and achieve the agility, dexterity, and athleticism required to be a world class table tennis player. At the same time, they are trying to juggle their schoolwork and upcoming college entrance applications, while also trying to have some kind of a social life amidst it all. They&apos;ll be interviews with them, as well as their parents, coaches, and friends along the way.

All in all, this well paced documentary kept my interest throughout, and I found it all quite interesting and informative as well.6.9

Justin TippingJahking Guillory, Christopher Meyer, Christopher Jordan WallaceA gorgeously done look at street life.

Kid saves some money to buy the fresh new Jordans to put on his feet other than the holely skips he was wearing, his life already changes from the confidence boost with a new swagger that attracts the girls. It also attracts trouble when the local crazy dude steels his kicks. Now the kid becomes obsessed with taking the slippers he&apos;s now force to wear off his feet and getting back his kicks at all cost.

I remember this life as a kid and how important Kicks were, and it sucks that Kids still have to worry about having their shoes taken. Then again, those 1st addiction Jordans could help pay someone&apos;s rent and put food on the table.

At first glace, its a horrible look at the what happens when you introduced Jordans to this culture (it seems to me not coincidence that the movie is about the re editions of the 1st Jordans), but all of that is superficial to the message of what really is important in life.

The young acting cast is very good, but I can&apos;t help but to give a shout out to Christopher Wallace Jr. not just because I&apos;m a fan of his father Biggie Smalls, but I think it&apos;s cool that he&apos;s an actor and he&apos;s good at it.

Overall, kicks gives me that colorful feeling I got when I saw Dope and Dear White People, although it has slightly more of a serious tone to it, and it needs that to get the message across. I like where all three of these films are going and how they are going there. Kicks is worth seeing.6.4

Wolfgang PetersenBrad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando BloomI love this movie, by far my favorite R rated movie and in the running for one of the greatest and most epic in my opinion. The acting, the world-building, the character depth, and the thrill of such an incredible depiction of the time period. I didn&apos;t think it was possible to make an accounting of the Trojan war void of the supernatural presence of the Greek Gods that rivals the old story in excellence, but this movie does.7.3

Peter JacksonIan McKellen, Martin Freeman, Richard ArmitageThe second entry in the Hobbit franchise improves on everything he first film got wrong. It doesn&apos;t waste any time and gets right into the action packed sequences. My only problem was the setting change at the end of the film. I felt like it didn&apos;t suit the climax. Overall, The Hobbit the Desalation of Smaug is a solid follow up to the first film building on the ideas the first film started.7.8

Peter JacksonMartin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard ArmitageIt&apos;s definitely no LOTR...But it&apos;s still a pretty cool movie. Sure, it took it&apos;s time to try to tell the story and dragged on for a little too long, but other than that, the special effects were great, and it was entertaining as hell. It&apos;s a good introduction to The Hobbit franchise.7.8
