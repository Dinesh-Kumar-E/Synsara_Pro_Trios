    "reviewBody": "Darker than ever, Lord Voldemort has been revealed in the &apos;Order of the Phoenix&apos;. The forces of darkness are gathering strength. Fear has spread throughout the wizard world. Harry Potter is now investigating Voldemort&apos;s plans through his old teacher Professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent).\n\nDirector David Yates returns and will for the remainder of the series. It has a more serious tone. The teenage love drama is heating up especially for Hermione and Ron. It comes to a head in this one in a satisfying melodrama.\n\nThe reveal of Voldemort&apos;s plan is a bit confusing. More effort is needed to explain what a Horcrux is. A scene with Voldemort creating one of the Hocrux would solve the problem. For the big death climax, the action is rather lacking. It needs more drama. I&apos;m reminded of &apos;Empire Strikes Back&apos;. In that movie, the big scene gets the most iconic treatment. Something like that is needed here. But it still works while following the book. That&apos;s probably more important.",

The acting was superb, and the performance I got from Tom Cruise was surprising to say the least.

The photography was excellent, the pacing was quick (despite the 3:15 runtime!), and the structure! the best thing about it. Although the movie does dwell on a very central theme--the price and necessity of salvation--much of the movie is left undone, as raw material for thinking about later, as if the characters just keep on living. As I said, it&apos;s not your standard movie fare. But don&apos;t dismiss it for what lies most visably on the surface; instead, sit through the movie, soak it in, and when it&apos;s done, turn out the lights and think about it for a while.

But then it strikes you, that what represents real depth, real quality is when a movie can be good without those features. When it&apos;s the dialogue, the story and the acting that strikes you. This film has really only two characters, all others play only minor roles (Cruise&apos;s girlfriend has some importance though). Two characters basically, and one dialogue - that&apos;s all you need when you&apos;ve got a script as good as this, and two such great actors. Only that is brilliant. But this film also has such fine, very true episodes, small stories in the larger film. One example is when Ray watches court TV with the working class woman and her many children out in the countryside...it&apos;s such a fine picture, just outstanding. ALL IN ALL A GREAT FILM!",

    "reviewBody": "7/10. This is a remake of Disney&apos;s 1977 classic, in which a lost little boy (Pete) finds friendship with a dinosaur called Elliot. Now I must say up front that I really was never a fan of the original, I found it dull and boring. It is not a big classic like a lot of other Disney films, but it still has a big following of people that love it. However I am very glad that they went back 39 years later and remade it, I really liked this film and thought it was a great film for the whole family, with heartfelt moments, funny moments and also action scenes that were good fun for adults and children. I have heard criticism of the way this film starts off, with Pete losing his parents, but honestly this is not a put off for young children and is made in a way that is not sad. My two young kids were not afraid in this film at all, and absolutely loved it. Director David Lowery does a fantastic job in this remake for families. Oakes Fegley who plays Pete really does a great job for a young boy, I think he might be one to watch in the future. Pete&apos;s Dragon #petesdragon https://m.facebook.com/Aussiemoviereview/",

The creators have done an excellent job in bringing out the emotions, the lip sync, and the body language of various animal, very well. The White Witch was scary as hell. The final battle sequence was spectacular. I was amazed with the battle sequence.\n\nAslan&apos;s character was the best. I love the way the Lion talks, walks and emotes.

    "reviewBody": "Judging from the comments archive, I can see why this film polarizes its audiences as much as it does. This film defies convention in all possible senses--characterization, dialogue, narrative structure, heck, even the introduction. To be honest, this movie is truly strange. But that doesn&apos;t necessarily make it bad. Quite the contrary, actually. In my opinion this is one of the best movies I&apos;ve seen. The acting was superb, and the performance I got from Tom Cruise was surprising to say the least. I don&apos;t expect much from him other than crocodile tears and beaming that thick smile, but here he credibly displayed a wide range of emotions. The photography was excellent, the pacing was quick (despite the 3:15 runtime!), and the structure! the best thing about it. Although the movie does dwell on a very central theme--the price and necessity of salvation--much of the movie is left undone, as raw material for thinking about later, as if the characters just keep on living. As I said, it&apos;s not your standard movie fare. But don&apos;t dismiss it for what lies most visably on the surface; instead, sit through the movie, soak it in, and when it&apos;s done, turn out the lights and think about it for a while. You&apos;ll be glad you did.",

Like no nature special you&apos;ve ever seen, directors Jacques Cluzaud, Michel Debats and Jacques Perrin and no fewer than fifteen credited cinematographers create a visual poem to these feathered marvels by taking us right into the thick of the action, somehow managing to get their cameras to fly, in beautifully coordinated fashion, right alongside the birds at amazing speeds and altitudes. Seeing is believing in the case of this film, and even after seeing it, you still may not believe it. That&apos;s how eye-popping and visually dazzling an experience this film is.\n\nWith only minimal narration (some of it spoken and some of it subtitled), the filmmakers provide some helpful information regarding the particular species we are seeing and its migratory patterns. But the film is far more of an aesthetic visual experience than an educational one. For long stretches of the movie, the birds merely fly along in majestic silence or backed up by haunting symphonic mood music (much of it reminiscent of the work in `Koyaanisqatsi&apos;). \n\nIn addition to the birds themselves and their amazing feats, the cinematography captures, with blindingly crystal clarity, the awesome beauty of the various landscapes through which these extraordinary creatures travel (there&apos;s even a shot of the birds flying past the Twin Towers). Watching this film is truly like being transported to another world. Nature has probably never looked this good on film.",

    "reviewBody": "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) \n\n** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is brought back to school where he faces a possible expulsion after using magic in the real world. Dumbledore (Jim McManus) comes to his defense and soon the two of them are warning people of the return of Lord Voldemort.\n\nAs I&apos;ve said in the reviews for the previous films, I haven&apos;t read any of the stories so I honestly can&apos;t compare the movie to the book. With that said, I did find the previous installment to be an extremely entertaining movie and certainly the best of the series to date. This fifth film is certainly a major step backwards and sadly there are way too many boring moments to make it a complete winner.\n\nAgain, perhaps I would have picked up on more things had I been familiar with the book but I personally found the majority of the first half to be quite boring without too many interesting things going on. I honestly thought there was very little character development and I thought too many of the scenes just kept dragging on with dialogue that just wasn&apos;t all that interesting or thrilling.\n\nThe film does finally pick up during its final act and this is where thing get really good. The final battles almost rival what we saw in the previous film and there&apos;s no question that they pack a lot of energy and excitement. They also benefit from some wonderful special effects that really put you in the middle of the action and blend perfectly well with the cast members. Speaking of the cast, a lot of talented actors keep getting added to the series and once again everyone is quite impressive. Regulars like Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and others return to their roles quite nicely and people like Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis are of great value.",
